# 💤 Nini Coin Pixel Art

This project features an adorable pixel art called **Nini Coin** — a cute little coin character themed around the idea of sleep, inspired by the American slang *"nini"* (meaning "time to go to bed").

## 🖼️ Artwork

The initial concept and AI-generated base art were created using **OpenAI's ChatGPT with DALL·E**, an AI-based image generation tool.  
Original concept by: **JasminDreasond**

> The artwork was created with a transparent background and a sleepy-time theme, including a purple nightcap for extra cuteness.

### 🌐 Origin of the Meme

The idea for **Nini Coin** started as a silly and wholesome joke among a group of friends on **Discord**.  
While playing around and making fun of crypto coins and random internet trends, someone (JasminDreasond) said "*nini coin*" as a pretend cryptocurrency for people who need to go to bed. The name stuck, and soon it turned into a cute bedtime mascot for everyone in the group.

## 🎨 Final Pixel Art

The final pixel art files were manually corrected and refined by **JasminDreasond**, ensuring crisp, clean pixel work suitable for use in games or web projects.

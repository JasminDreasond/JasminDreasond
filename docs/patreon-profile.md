<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Mio! Welcome to my tiny Patreon! :3
</p>
<p>
  This page is my tiny place where you can support the projects I create and share online. 
  By joining, youâ€™re helping not only the content I make for my projects, 
  but also my more personal works such as <strong>Pony Driland</strong>, my ongoing fic, 
  and <strong>Pony House</strong>, my Matrix client project.
</p>
<p>
  I also dedicate a lot of my time to developing open-source libraries for the community. 
  Contributing to free and accessible tools is something very important to me, and your support 
  allows me to keep improving these projects while exploring new ideas.
</p>
<p>
  Most of my premium content and ways to reach me are available through other platforms, 
  so be sure to join my <a href="https://discord.gg/TgHdvJd">Discord server</a> or visit 
  <a href="https://puddy.club">Puddy Club</a> to access everything I share.

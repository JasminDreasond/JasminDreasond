<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Mio! Welcome to my tiny Patreon! :3
</p>
<p>
  This page is my tiny place where you can support the projects I create and share online. 
  By joining, you’re helping not only the content I make for my projects, 
  but also my more personal works such as <strong>Pony Driland</strong>, my ongoing fic, 
  and <strong>Pony House</strong>, my Matrix client project.
</p>
<p>
  I also dedicate a lot of my time to developing open-source libraries for the community. 
  Contributing to free and accessible tools is something very important to me, and your support 
  allows me to keep improving these projects while exploring new ideas.
</p>
<p>
  Most of my premium content and ways to reach me are available through other platforms, 
  so be sure to join my <a href="https://discord.gg/TgHdvJd">Discord server</a> or visit 
  <a href="https://puddy.club">Puddy Club</a> to access everything I share.
</p>

<h2>Open Source Development</h2>
<p>
  Here are some of the libraries I actively maintain in the open-source community:

</ul>

<h2>My content</h2>
<p>
  Whenever any of my content involves AI in some way, I always make sure to mention it in the credits. 
  I want everyone to know exactly how the work was made, because I care a lot about transparency.
</p>
<p>
  AI is only used when it’s truly necessary, like for experiments or tools that help me speed up some processes, 
  but I never replace the core work with it. Everything important that requires real skill and creativity is done by me, personally.
</p>

<h2>Why Even $1 Matters</h2>
<p>
  I want to be honest with you, but in a friendly way: even the tiniest donation makes a huge difference to me! 
  If everyone chips in at least <strong>$1</strong>, it might seem small by itself, but together it can really help me keep doing all the fun projects I love.
</p>
<p>
  Every $1 you give isn’t just a coin—it’s a little hug that says, “I believe in your work!” 
  It makes me super happy and motivated to keep creating, coding, and sharing stories with you. 
  So if you feel like it, giving just $1 already makes you a super tiny pudding in my heart. :3
